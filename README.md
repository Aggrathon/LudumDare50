# The Extraterrestial Farm Enterprise - Ludum Dare 50

![Banner image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aggrathon/LudumDare50/gh-pages/banner.png)

A game about managing a farm on an extraterrestial planet with lush (almost aggressive) flora (while also trying to pay back a loan to the space mafia).

My entry to the 50:th Ludum Dare game jam (theme: *Delay the inevitable*), following the compo rules (alone, from scratch, 48 hours).

[Play the game in Your browser](https://aggrathon.github.io/LudumDare50/) or [check out the Ludum Dare entry](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50/the-extraterrestial-farm-enterprise)!

## Tips

The fertility of the soil affects how fast both crops and weeds grow.  
Remember compound interest (the debt grows faster the more debt you have).  

## Software Used

Unity (game engine), Visual Studio Code (code), Gimp (art), Paint.net (art), Audacity (sound), Bosca Ceoil (music), Righteous (font), OneNote (notes), git (version control), and Github (hosting).
