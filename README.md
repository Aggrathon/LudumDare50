# The Extraterrestial Farm Enterprise - Ludum Dare 50

A game about managing a farm on an extraterrestial planet with lush (almost aggressive) flora (while also trying to pay back a loan to the space mafia).

My entry to the 50:th Ludum Dare game jam (theme: *Delay the inevitable*), following the compo rules (alone, from scratch, 48 hours).
